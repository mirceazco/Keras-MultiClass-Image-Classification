# VGGNet16 
<p align="justify"> VGG16 se refera la modelul VGG, numit si VGGNet. Este un model de retea neurala convoluzionala (CNN) cu suport pentru 16 straturi. Modelul VGG16 poate atinge o precizie de testare de 92,7% in ImageNet, un set de date care contine peste 14 milioane de imagini de antrenament din 1000 de clase de obiecte. Este unul dintre modelele de top din competitia ILSVRC-2014.
VGG16 aduce imbunatatiri fata de AlexNet si inlocuieste filtrele mari cu secvente de filtre mai mici de 3Ã—3. In AlexNet, dimensiunea kernelului este de 11 pentru primul strat convoluzional si 5 pentru al doilea strat. Cercetatorii au antrenat modelul VGG timp de cateva saptamani folosind unitati de procesare grafica (GPU) NVIDIA Titan Black. 


<p align="justify"> The aim of this capstone project is to build a convolutional neural network that classifies different weather conditions while working reasonably well under constraints of computation. The work described in this report translates to two contributions to the field of weather classification. The first one is exploring the use of data augmentation technique, considering different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for the feature extraction process when classifying outdoor scenes in a multi-class setting using general-purpose images. The second contribution is the creation of a new, open source dataset, consisting of images collected online that depict scenes of five weather conditions.

# Dependencies :
- Python 3.5
- keras `conda install keras`
- tensorflow `conda install tensorflow`

Note that keras and tensorflow have their own dependencies. I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for handlinng the packages.

# Dataset :
The Weather dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vijaygiitk/multiclass-weather-dataset) (that I've uploaded there).
